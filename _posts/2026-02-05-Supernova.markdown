 At the boundary of music and sound design exists a zone of…uncertainty..

The traditional approach was to throw together some existing recordings of sound effects and call it a day.

But in the 1970s, pioneers like Suzanne Ciani demonstrated that vast, imaginative soundscapes could be created from the ground up, using synthesizers to generate the raw elements, and playing the recording studio like an instrument.

The cosmic soundscape you're about to hear was generated directly from circuit-to-tape and waveform-to-workstation. 

It never existed as audio until it strikes your eardrums after being rendered by speakers or headphones.

No microphones were used, and modern equipment was only sparsely employed to manipulate raw waveforms Musique Concrète-style.

## A new kind of noise

In the spirit of analog 1970s planetariums, this sketch depicts the death and afterlife of a massive star, featuring a sound you may never have heard before: 

--The highly detailed bone-rattling explosion is realized with the Advanced Noise Generator, built by the world’s leading KSP developer Mario Krušelj and the late Stephen Howell, a legendary figure in the world of sound design.

No demos of the Advanced Noise Generator seem to exist on YouTube, but it allows programming of tremendous detail of white noise sources. It is employed both in the cataclysmic stellar explosion and the cosmic winds heard throughout the composition.

A timeline at the bottom of the screen indicates all the “story points". The astrophysical information is accurate both today, and relative to what was known in the 1970s.

Watch until the end of the video to hear a special “no talking” album version of the planetarium music that underscored the introduction.

Point 1
Dying Star
In this massive star, nuclear fusion can no longer fight the gravity of the heavy elements being produced.

You knew it was coming…
I just wanted to leave an after- 
image burned on your retina. 

In reality, matter is being 
converted to pure energy.
The number of photons being 
produced is mind-boggling.



Condensation
As time passes, the hot ionized plasma cools and condenses into an expanding cloud of stellar material.

Structure
As it expands, the nova begins to display the arrangement of the nebula
Taking Shape
As it expands, the ejected stellar material begins to display the structure of the eventual nebula.

Into the inferno
In the tradition of planetarium shows, we imagine what it might be like to journey into the shell of this evolving supernova

Aftermath Revealed
The remnant of the exploded star is hidden by a rippling shell of magnetic fields and particles.
At the heart of this conflagration, a monster lurks…
Something strange is driving these charged particles to nearly the speed of light.



Cosmic Engine
Nebula gasses cool and expand..
There are many possible outcomes of supernova events,
But this one is of particular interest.
At the center of the explosion, where the star once stood, beats the heart of a monster…

Pulsar Revealed
The collapsed core of the original star has formed a pulsar, a spinning neutron star smaller than Mount Everest, but billions of times more dense.

The pulsar emits deadly beams of electromagnetic radiation from its magnetic poles, shooting out into space like a lighthouse.

We detect these beams as radio waves, clicking eerily in the darkness like a monumental phantom heartbeat of a dead star. 

But if conditions were slightly different, this central neutron star would have continued to  collapse, forming a black hole.. 

Thanks!
I hope you enjoyed this “audio planetarium”
 experiment.
If you have an “ambience head” (a brain that is particularly responsive to spatial cues), you may also enjoy closing your eyes and listening to this sonic sketch through headphones or a home theater surround system. 4-channel cues have been matrixed into the audio mix.

If that last statement makes no sense, but you are intrigued, try it anyhow. You may discover a new area of stereo enjoyment.

Synthesizers, sound and sonic sorcery. Space-based audio essays featuring a retro-planetarium vibe and a surround-sound sensibility.



This video, the audio elements, and the space music soundtrack were all constructed from the ground up as an original creation. No templates or AI were employed. 

No stock footage was used except for some brief background clips and a MOGRT from Pixabay, which were used as a base to animate over. 

The astronomical reference was based on NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory imagery, particularly the “pulsar wind” sequence.

The only sound not created specifically for this video was a brief snippet of the Outer Limits Control Tone, which seemed particularly salient to the sequence.

The visual effects were generated using Cinema 4D, Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere. 
The multitrack studio was Reaper digital audio workstation.

Instruments used:
     • Alesis Fusion
     • ASM Hydrasynth Deluxe
     • Behringer Neutron
     • Ensoniq ESQ1
     • Ensoniq SQ-80

Thanks for watching this far. I hope you enjoy the title track, “Light of a Thousand Days”...

A high-impact retro-planetarium audio experience. This sonic supernova is a sound design experiment in outer space ambience with all-new visualizations and a special bonus space music overture at the end.

Featuring the Hollow Sun Advanced Noise Generator, the Ensoniq ESQ1, Hydrasynth Deluxe, and 4-channel cues  matrixed into the audio mix for surround systems such as Dolby Atmos or the Involve Audio Surround Master.
