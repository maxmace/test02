The Holographic Principle is our cosmic pretext for examining the more euphoric regions of propulsive Space Music.

"Inside a Glass Sphere" is a 70’s - inspired epic cinematic planetarium opus. If you sat down in a cool planetarium on a hot day 50 years ago to experience some of that newfangled laser rock, I imagine this is the kind of ultimate trip you might experience.

Real Science disclaimer: 
The Holographic Principle described in this video is more of a thought experiment than a valid explanation of reality. Like the Boltzmann Brain concept, it is a theory which (as of now) cannot be tested. You can relax. You’re in a safe place and no one is hassling you.
