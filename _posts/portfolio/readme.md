### Youtube embed format and parameters

The "Full Capability" Syntax
If you want to use every single "bell and whistle" programmed into the site, here is the exact syntax to use in Markdown posts.

This is formatted with carriage returns for readability, which the strip_newlines code in "_includes/youtube.html" should handle perfectly:

{% include youtube.html 
   id="COxMHHi6apU" 
   start="436" 
   end="520" 
   thumb="img/nova.jpg" 
   title="The Supernova Exploration - Orchestral Version" %}
   
#### Parameter Breakdown
Parameter	Purpose	Example
id	The 11-character YouTube video ID.	Example: COxMHHi6apU
start	The time (in seconds) where the video should begin.	Example: 436
end	The time (in seconds) where the video should stop.	Example: 520 (see lower in this readme page for second-counting hack)
thumb	Path to your custom image (relative to the site root).	img/nova.jpg. Need to use img/ root, Example: "img/portfolio/thumb.png"  THIS LINE IS OPTIONAL. WILL PICK UP YOUTUBE THUMB IF NOT SPECIFIED
title	The text that appears in the caption box below the video.	My Video Title


### unique_id scheme 
The unique_id scheme is designed to be a "set it and forget it" safety net. It ensures that if you have three videos on one page, clicking "Play" on the third one doesn't accidentally try to start the first one.

How the unique_id works
In your _includes/youtube.html, we create the ID using this logic:
{{ include.id }}-{{ include.start | default: '0' }}-{{ include.thumb | slugify }}

include.id: This is the YouTube string (like COxMHHi6apU).

include.start: If you play the same video twice but starting at different times, this keeps them distinct.

include.thumb: Since you use custom thumbnails, we "slugify" the filename (turning My Image.jpg into my-image-jpg) to make the ID even more specific.

The id (the YouTube video code) is the only strictly mandatory part. Without it, there is no video to load! The others (start, end, thumb, title) are optional.

## WARNING
Unique ID Collisions: In the rare event you use the exact same video with the exact same start time and the exact same thumbnail twice on one single page, the IDs will collide. If you ever need to do that, just add a dummy character to the title or use a slightly different start time (e.g., 436 and 437) to keep them unique.

### Pro-Tip: Finding the "Seconds"
Since your parameters require seconds rather than minutes:seconds, a quick way to calculate it is:

(Minutes×60)+Seconds=TotalSeconds
For example, if you want the video to start at 7:16:

(7×60)+16=436 seconds

### CSS cheat sheet (as of 2026-02-20)

(Generated by google gemini)
Since we’ve spent a lot of time building a specific "Cosmic" aesthetic for Memory Wheel, this table covers the custom classes we've integrated into your Jekyll setup.

🚀 Memory Wheel CSS Cheat Sheet
Class Name	Target Element	Effect
.hollow-text	<h2>, <h1>, <span>	Transparent fill with a white stroke and a neon cyan glow. Perfect for "Cosmic" headers.
.video-container	<div> (Wrapper)	Forces a 16:9 aspect ratio and black background. Essential for the YouTube include.
.play-overlay	<div> (Inside video)	Creates the circular play button with the triangle icon. Uses pointer-events: none.
.post-reference-box	<div> or <blockquote>	Large, italicized LightCyan text with a border. Best for quotes, lyrics, or poems.
.post-info-box	<div>	A technical-looking box with PowderBlue borders and heavy padding. Used for instructions or logs.
.inline-spinner	<img>	Applies a slow, 40s linear rotation. Designed for the planet/star icons in your headers.
.star-light-custom	<hr>	A horizontal divider that looks like a glowing cyan beam instead of a flat line.
.audio-player-container	<div>	A glassmorphism box (blur effect) for the native HTML5 audio player.
🎨 Color Palette Reference
If you need to match new elements to the existing theme:

Deep Space (Background): #0d1017

Cosmic Cyan (Accents): #00f2ff

Dusty Indigo (Articles): #1b1e2b

Agency Yellow (Original): #fed136 (Used sparingly now)

Usage Example for "Hollow Text"
To use the glowing header style in a post, you can use raw HTML:

HTML
<h2 class="hollow-text">New Galaxy Discovered</h2>
