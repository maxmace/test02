Modern electronic tonalities for listening and relaxation. This study represents a Switched-On retro-planetarium Moog synthesizer tribute to the music of Wendy Carlos and Isao Tomita.

- 06:37 Bach 13 (for laser and synthesizer)
- 08:00 The Secret Clock at the Heart of the Universe

Although several vintage hardware units contribute to this recording, only one of them is an actual Moog product. In the spirit of Switched-On Bach 2000, I leave it to the listener as an exercise in identification.

No AI tools were used in the creation, performance, or production of this music. It was arranged, performed, and recorded by a human being with feelings who uses the oxford comma inconsistently throughout the listeners notes.

Both of the artists of focus for this recording released treatments of the same two part invention during the 20th century. They differ significantly from what I have premiered here, and I encourage you to seek them out.

Speaking of "tonalities", visit synth wizard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@9KznfiS87f7">Kirk Slinkard’s channel @9KznfiS87f7</a> to hear the best sounds and learn how they were crafted. The white noise and PWM patches heard in this recording were accomplished through techniques detailed in his videos.
