13:10  Listener Notes

Cinematic Ambient Fusion. A salute to the long running radio program Music from the Hearts of Space https://www.hos.com. 
--Tip of the hat to popular ambient producer @s1gns0fl1fe

Listen to this music any way you wish! It has been deliberately composed and engineered to function as effective background but also reward active listening. 

#### Additional sound-creation info:
The all-encompassing sound of ocean surf you hear on this recording is neither a digital sample or a synthesizer re-creation. It is the sound of the Ensoniq ESQ-1/SQ-80 fulminating gong running through the unique bloom reverb of an Alesis Midiverb II and Alesis Wedge. The sound is comprised of sine, bell, and the distinctive ESQ-1 "noise 2" waveform. 

You will hear unprocessed instances of the gong on this recording, but when coupled with the vintage Alesis algorithms, the uncorrelated stereo wash of the electric surf becomes iconic and powerful, reminiscent of "The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore" from  Irv Teibel's classic 1968 "Environments 1" recording.
