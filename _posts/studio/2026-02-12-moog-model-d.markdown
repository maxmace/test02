### The Heart of the Signal Path

The **Moog Model D** is more than just a synthesizer; in the context of 1970s planetarium music, it was the primary engine for creating a sense of scale. When you hear those deep, resonant sweeps that feel like a starship engine engaging, you are likely hearing the three-oscillator drift of a Model D.

#### Why it matters for "Memory Wheel"

To achieve the "Anemoia" effect, I utilize the original 24dB per octave ladder filter. This provides a specific harmonic "warmth" that modern digital recreations often struggle to emulate perfectly.

* **Oscillators:** 3 Voltage Controlled Oscillators (VCOs)
* **Filter:** The legendary Moog Ladder Filter
* **Use Case:** Lead melodies and drone foundations



In future compositions, this unit is paired with a vintage tape delay to create the "infinite trail" effect characteristic of 70s space-ambient.
