### Creating the Void

In space music, silence is just as important as sound. However, to make silence feel "large," you need a specific type of spatial processing. The **Eventide Black Hole** algorithm is a staple in the Memory Wheel studio for this exact reason.

#### The Geometry of Reverb

Unlike a "Room" or "Hall" reverb which tries to emulate a physical space on Earth, the Black Hole is designed to sound unnatural and vast. 

* **Gravity & Resonance:** By manipulating the feedback loops, I can create a "shimmer" that sounds like light reflecting off an icy nebula.
* **Modulation:** Adding slight pitch-shifting to the reverb trails helps prevent the sound from becoming static, giving it an "organic" drift.



#### Technical Setup

I typically run the signal from the Moog through a stereo chain into the Eventide processors. By keeping the mix at approximately **45% wet**, the original analog transient remains sharp while the tail fades into a seemingly infinite horizon. 

This specific combination is what creates the "Planetarium" vibe—dry, intimate hardware sounds floating in a massive, synthetic void.
