### Creating the Void
To Simon and Garfunkel, the sound of silence was a metaphor for an existential paradox that resulted in a famous commercial moneymaker decrying commercial fame and money-making..

In space music, silence is just as important as sound. The space between sounds is a psychoacoustic cue. If the silence is literally silent, listeners perceive a lack of space. Ironically, to convey vast nothingness, we need to fill that space with something. 

Eventide’s Blackhole is an iconic, "otherworldly" reverb that originated as a algorithm in the DSP4000 Ultra-Harmonizer rack unit in 1994. Today's familiar pedal and stompbox version is a modern version of that original rack processor preset. 

 To make silence feel "large," you need a specific type of spatial processing. 

#### The Geometry of Reverb

Unlike a "Room" or "Hall" reverb which tries to emulate a physical space on Earth, the Black Hole is designed to sound unnatural and vast.

Another take on the same motif:

* **Gravity & Resonance:** By manipulating the feedback loops, I can create a "shimmer" that sounds like light reflecting off an icy nebula.
* **Modulation:** Adding slight pitch-shifting to the reverb trails helps prevent the sound from becoming static, giving it an "organic" drift.



#### Technical Setup

I typically run the signal from the Moog through a stereo chain into the Eventide processors. By keeping the mix at approximately **45% wet**, the original analog transient remains sharp while the tail fades into a seemingly infinite horizon. 

This specific combination is what creates the "Planetarium" vibe—dry, intimate hardware sounds floating in a massive, synthetic void.
