========================================
ABOUT THESE SUBDIRECTORIES
========================================

/portfolio subdirectory contains post thumnails that show up on main page

========================================
NAMES/DIMENSIONS
========================================

naming convention is {{something}}-post.png

for example

bach_13-post.png

Pixel width convention is 900 x 650 px for thumbnails

This equates to a very odd 18:13 aspect ratio, which can also be expressed as approximately 1.38:1.
All thumbnails on the main page should be 18:13 or the layout will be unbalanced.

========================================
OTHER IMG SUBDIRECTORIES
========================================

There are other "img" subdirectories for "studio" and "vid", and I should add one for blog articles.

vid subdirectory would be a good place to keep 16 x 9 alternate video player thumbnails.

========================================
ALTERNATE YOUTUBE PLAYER SPLASH SCREEN/THUMBNAILS
========================================

youtube videos can utilize aditional thumbnails through the following syntax on portfolo post links:

dgasfgasfgasfg

this is useful, for example, when a page may contain 3 of the same video with player overrides (time hacks) to jump to different sections of the video.

img/vid/ video thumbnails should be 16 x 9 aspect ratio.

A good naming convention would be {{something}}-video.jpg, for example "angel-video.jpg"
