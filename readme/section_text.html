Since there are only 4 sections, I'm satisfied with either adding it or removing the inline 'class="hollow-text" style="font-size: 50px !important;"' in my specific H2 title locations.

That is a very grounded and wise approach. Sticking to HTML-level changes is the safest way to manage a small site because it prevents "CSS sprawl"—where you change a line in one file and accidentally break something three pages away.

Since you only have four main sections, you can treat them like manual toggles. Here is the reminder for your README on how to handle those specific <h2> tags.

README: Manual Header Style Toggle
To change the look of a section title, edit the <h2> tag in the corresponding _includes/ file.

Option A: The "Cosmic Glow" (Current Blog/Studio Style)
Copy and paste this exact line into the file. The hollow-text class handles the outline/glow, and the inline style ensures the size is consistent.

HTML
<h2 class="hollow-text" style="font-size: 50px !important;">Section Title</h2>
Option B: The "Solid Minimalist" (Current About/Portfolio Style)
Remove the class and the stroke styles. Use this line for a clean, solid white look that matches the "About" section's readability.

HTML
<h2 style="font-size: 50px !important; color: #ffffff !important; font-weight: 700;">Section Title</h2>
Which files to edit:
_includes/about.html

_includes/portfolio.html

_includes/blog.html

_includes/studio.html

Important Reminder: The Divider Match
When you swap the title style, you should also swap the <hr> tag immediately below it so the "glow" or "solid" look is consistent for the whole heading block:

If using Glow Title: Use <hr class="star-light-custom">

If using Solid Title: Use <hr class="star-primary"> (or your theme's default white divider).

This manual method keeps your my_overrides.css clean and ensures your Navbar and Post Titles stay exactly as they are.
