                    Man-made music. Created for our shared cosmic adventure.
                    <br><br>
                    Melody-driven space music for encouraging thoughtful fun. Rich electro/symphonic sound featuring dynamic, evolving orchestration, world class recording techniques and the best in audio fidelity.
                    <br><br>
                    deliberately designed to work great both as contemplative background music (e.g. "ambient for study" :smiley: ) or for active listening as a 1970s album-oriented experience!

                    You may not have nostalgia for analog planetariums and 1970’s space music…. <em>Yet</em>.

                    The term “anemoia” describes a sense of longing for a time or experience that one has never lived through.
                    <br><br>
                    Imagine an era where--for the first time--the combined voice of the symphony orchestra and the new sonic palette of analog synthesizers combine to evoke the awe and wonder of cosmic grandeur.

                    Memory Wheel is your laser-fueled time machine to an age where projected light combined with sounds in space in a brand-new way.
