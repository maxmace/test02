                    Man-made music. Created for our shared cosmic adventure.
                    <br><br>
                    Fun, melody-driven space music. Rich evolving sound and orchestration to prevent ear fatigue.
                    <br><br>
                    deliberately designed to work great both as contemplative background music (ambient for study) or for active listening as a 1970s album oriented experience!

                    You may not have nostalgia for analog planetariums and 1970’s space music…. <em>Yet</em>.

                    The term “anemoia” describes a sense of longing for a time or experience that one has never lived through.
                    <br><br>
                    Imagine an era where--for the first time--the combined voice of the symphony orchestra and the new sonic palette of analog synthesizers combine to evoke the awe and wonder of cosmic grandeur.
                    <br><br>
                    Memory Wheel is your laser-fueled time machine back to an age where new sounds combined with images in space for the first time.
